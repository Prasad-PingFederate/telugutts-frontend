# 🔧 Backend Error Fix - Quick Summary

## The Problem
Your website shows: **"Error: Backend error: The page could not be found - NOT_FOUND"**

## Root Cause
Your frontend (`script.js`) is calling `/api/tts`, but Vercel doesn't have this API route configured. It doesn't know where to send the request.

## The Fix
Create a Vercel serverless function (`api/tts.js`) that acts as a proxy to your RunPod backend.

---

## 🎯 What You Need to Do (Quick Version)

### 1. Add API File to GitHub
In your `telugutts-frontend` repository:
- Create folder: `api/`
- Create file: `api/tts.js`
- Copy content from the `api/tts.js` file I created

### 2. Add RunPod API Key to Vercel
- Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
- Add: `RUNPOD_API_KEY` = your RunPod API key
- Save

### 3. Push to GitHub
```bash
git add api/tts.js
git commit -m "Fix backend API routing"
git push
```

### 4. Wait for Vercel to Deploy
Vercel auto-deploys in 1-2 minutes.

### 5. Test
Visit https://telugutts.com and try converting text to speech.

```
User visits telugutts.com
    ↓
Enters text and clicks "Convert to Speech"
    ↓
Frontend calls /api/tts (Vercel serverless function)
    ↓
Vercel calls RunPod endpoint with your API key
    ↓
RunPod runs handler.py (gTTS generates audio)
    ↓
Audio returns as base64 to Vercel
    ↓
Vercel sends audio to frontend
    ↓
Frontend plays audio
```
